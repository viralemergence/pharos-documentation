# Follow these steps to publish your data

Publishing your data adds it to the public PHAROS database, which means that your datasets and your project metadata will be visible on the public map and in the public data table. Data can be unpublished at any time. 

## Publishing

1. ### Create a new project

2. ### Create a new dataset within that project

- Name the dataset

- Dataset units are not yet customizable; at the moment the system accepts only SI units

3. ### Upload a CSV into your dataset

- Press the "Add rows from CSV" button to upload a CSV

- Uploading a second CSV will add the new data to the end of the dataset

- CSV template and column definitions can be downloaded on the project list page

- Having extra columns in your dataset will stop the dataset from being publishable on PHAROS

4. ### Click "Release dataset" when you are ready for the system to validate your data

Refer to the column defintions CSV, or click the "+" sign in each cell to read the defintion. Columns that currently are validated are: 

- **Host species NCBI tax ID** 

- **Latitude** must be a valid latitudinal value

- **Longitude** must be a valid longitudinal value

- **Collection day, collection month, and collection year** must, taken together, read as a valid date

- **Organism sex**

- **Dead or alive**

- **Age** must be a numerical value

- **Mass** must be a numerical value

- **Length** must be a numberical value

5. ### Fix any errors discovered after dataset validation

6. ### When errors are fixed, click "Release dataset" again to successfully release

7. ### When dataset is released, return to the project page

- Data is only publishable at the project level 

8. ### On the project page, click "Publish" button 

- When you click the "Publish" button on a project, all "Released"  datasets will be published

## Unpublishing

- Projects can be unpublished at any time, and republished at any time after that 

- Click the dot menu and then click "Unpublish project"
