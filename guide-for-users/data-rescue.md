# Data rescue and digitization

## Should I submit published data that I've digitized?

For now, no - unless it's your own data.

## Will PHAROS eventually support data rescue efforts?

Hopefully. This is an ethics question, not a feasibility question: We're currently deciding the best way to recover large quantities of data from the published literature, while also honoring the principles around credit and equity that have shaped our approach. We will seek input from the community on this issue in the future.
