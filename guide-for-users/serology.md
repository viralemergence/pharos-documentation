# Serological studies

Data from serological studies are incredibly welcome in PHAROS. Researchers should record sample metadata as usual, but note the relevant methods in "Detection method" and related fields, and - if possible - share both raw data and a comment about the cutoff for seropositivity. For example:


| Host species      | Detection method    | Detection target | Detection outcome | 
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Desmodus rotundus | neutralization test |  Rabies virus  | Positive          | 

| Detection measurement | Detection measurement units | Detection comments            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| 0.15                  | IU/mL                       | Cutoff of 0.1 IU/mL |
