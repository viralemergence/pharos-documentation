# How to handle serological data

Data from wildlife serostudies are incredibly welcome in PHAROS. 

Researchers should record sample metadata as usual, but note the relevant methods in "Detection method" and related fields, and - if possible - share both raw data and a comment about the cutoff for seropositivity. For example:


| | Host species      | Detection method    | Detection target | Detection outcome | 
|-|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
|1| Desmodus rotundus | neutralization test |  Rabies virus  | Positive          | 

| | Detection measurement | Detection measurement units | Detection comments            |
|-|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|1| 0.15                  | IU/mL                       | Cutoff of 0.1 IU/mL |
