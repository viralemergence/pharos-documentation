# What's coming soon?

A few limitations on the current platform are slated for improvements:
- Data entry is currently capped at < 1,000 rows per dataset; this limit will eventually be lifted.
- Datasets currently require complete (day, month, and year) date information; we will eventually implement solutions to allow user to enter data with incomplete dates.
- Users will eventually be allowed to change passwords.

# What's coming eventually?

In the medium term, our team has several development priorities, including:
- Direct linkage to other databases (e.g., through GenBank accessions)
- Search functionality on the map interface
- Automated tracking of data citations by webscraping 

# What are some long-term problems?

Eventually, we hope to implement features like:
- Automatic updating of taxonomic information in PHAROS as the NCBI taxonomic backbone updates
- Integration of AI-driven tools for risk forecasts related to human or livestock health
- An open-source developer toolkit so that the community can curate and improve PHAROS
