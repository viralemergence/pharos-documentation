# Quick start guide

We welcome all open surveillance datasets.

**Set up an account**

In order to upload your data to PHAROS, you first need to set up an account. For the time being, you must email INSERT EMAIL so that we can set up the account for you. We will need your first and last name, the email that you would like associated with the account, and the name of your institutional affiliation. We will then send you a password to use at login. 

**Format your data**

Before uploading your data to PHAROS, make sure that the data are formatted according to our formatting standards. A CSV template and the column definitions are available for download on the "All Projects" page of your account. Data that are not formatted according to our standards will not pass the validation check and thus will not be published. 

**Manage your project**

Within your account you can create projects, edit project metadata, and upload and delete datasets within your projects. 

**Publish your data**

Publishing your data adds it to the public PHAROS database, which means that your datasets and your project metadata will be publicly visible on the site to someone without an account. At the moment, publishing is a two-step process. Step 1: When a dataset is finalized, you may click the "Release dataset" button on the dataset page, which will mark the dataset as ready to be published. Step 2: When there are released datasets within a project, you may click the "Publish" button on your project page. After a project has been published, any "released" datasets will be made public, and any "unreleased" datasets will not. To unpublish your project, find the "Unpublish project" button in your project menu. Unpublishing your project will remove it from public access.
