## How to handle macroparasites 

If you're identifying macroparasites from an animal sample - say visual inspection for ectoparasites, or necropsy for endoparasites - you might not be running "tests" on "samples" in the familiar sense. We suggest that you 
- think about the animal itself as equivalent to the "sample", 
- report detailed information on both parasite collection and identification, including sequence data if used for molecular identification, and 
- report count data as "outcome data" as appropriate 

For example, a researcher  might report the identification of a shark tapeworm through a mix of both visual and molecular features, and include a link to the parasite sequence:

| Host species  | Collection method or tissue | Detection method  | Detection outcome | Pathogen  | GenBank accession |
| ---------- |  ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |  ---------- | ---------- |  
| _Squalus mitsukurii_ |  Intestine (dissection) | Electron microscopy, NGS | Positive | _Trilocularia eberti_  | GB8675309 |

Another researcher screening a bat for bat flies might report that they identified three batflies (_Basilia fletcheri_) on one individual, but another had no batflies of any kind:


| Sample ID  | Animal ID | Host species  | Detection target | Detection method | 
| ---------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| scdo001       | scdo001    | _Scotozous dormeri_ |  Nycteribiidae  | Visual |
| scdo002       | scdo002    | _Scotozous dormeri_ |  Nycteribiidae  | Visual |


| Detection outcome | Pathogen | Detection measurement |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------- | 
| Positive      |_Scotozous dormeri_ |   3   | 
| Negative      | -   | - |  

## Atypical data

Remember that PHAROS is only intended to be used with "line list" data of host-parasite associations. Examples of macroparasite observations that would be better suited for GBIF could include
- observation of mite presence in an entire beehive (not individual host level)
- leech presence in a swamp (not an observation of a host-parasite interaction)
- a preserved parasite in a collection without any metadata on collection or host
