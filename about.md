## About Verena

The Verena Institute (formerly the Viral Emergence Research Initiative) was founded in 2019 and established as a National Science Foundation Biology Integration Institute in 2022. Our mission is to use the science of the host-virus network to advance efforts to predict, prevent, and prepare for disease emergence. The Institute's work includes a mix of data synthesis, algorithm-in-the-loop machine learning, model-guided experiments, and boots-on-the-ground partnerships. All of our data and code is 100% open, giving you the tools you need to study viral emergence from anywhere in the world. Using that platform, we're training the next generation of scientists, from K-12 up through graduate and postgraduate mentorship.

## About Pharos

The Pathogen Harmonized Surveillance database is an open-access atlas of wildlife disease data. Where comparable databases exist for free-living organisms, they occasionally include data on microbes, but are rarely built to capture the structure of symbiotic interactions, and are nearly never intended to store negative data, the "dark matter" that constitutes the majority of surveillance data by volume. PHAROS is a global open-access repository for wildlife disease surveillance, meant to enable data sharing across borders and projects in real-time, with built-in citation systems for credit and attribution, easy cross-linkage to other databases like GenBank, and an active community of practice that fosters innovation in viral ecology and public health.
