# Funding support

PHAROS has been made possible by funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation to the Verena program (NSF BII 2021909 and NSF BII 2213854), as well as in-kind contributions from Georgetown's Center for Global Health Science & Security, which is supported by a research grant from Open Philanthropy.

## Can my organization support PHAROS?

**Yes!** 
There is currently no dedicated funding behind this initiative: dedicated financial support would help keep our platform online, and ensure continued development of new features to support the global scientific community. If you're interested in supporting our work, contact Colin Carlson (colin.carlson@georgetown.edu) or Ellie Graeden (ellie.graeden@georgetown.edu).
