## About Verena

The Verena Institute (formerly the Viral Emergence Research Initiative) was founded in 2019 and established as a National Science Foundation Biology Integration Institute in 2022. The Institute's mission is to use the science of the host-virus network to advance efforts to predict, prevent, and prepare for disease emergence. Our work includes a mix of data synthesis, algorithm-in-the-loop machine learning, model-guided experiments, and boots-on-the-ground partnerships. 

## About Pharos

The Pathogen Harmonized Surveillance database is an open-access atlas of wildlife disease data. Where comparable databases exist for free-living organisms and occasionally include data on micro-organisms, PHAROS is built specifically for host-pathogen interactions.
