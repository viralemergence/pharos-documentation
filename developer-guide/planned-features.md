# Planned development 

## What's up next to build?

A few limitations on the current platform are slated for improvements:

- Data entry is currently capped at < 1,000 rows per dataset; this limit will eventually be lifted

- Datasets currently require complete (day, month, and year) date information; we will eventually implement solutions to allow user to enter data with incomplete dates

- Dataset units will soon be customizable

- Users will soon be allowed to change passwords and edit their profile information

- The publishing workflow will soon be simplified

## What's coming in the medium-term?

Medium-term development priorities include:

- Direct linkages to other databases (e.g., through GenBank accessions)

- Search and filter functionality on the map interface

- Automated tracking of data citations by webscraping 

## What are some long-term goals?

Eventually, we hope to implement features like:

- Automatic updating of taxonomic information in PHAROS as the NCBI taxonomic backbone updates

- Integration of AI-driven tools for risk forecasts related to human or livestock health

- An open-source developer toolkit so that the community can curate and improve PHAROS
