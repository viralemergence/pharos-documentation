# Before you start...

PHAROS is in its early days. Eventually, we hope that there will be enough data to support massive secondary analyses, in much the same way as GenBank, GISAID, or GBIF have supported. For now, though, there are only a few beta testers' contributions available, and correspondingly, this section of the documentation is in early stages of development.
